# SpeechRecognitionML
In this project I have build a simple speech recognition application that takes input as instructions from the user and performs that
operations for the user.

The python libraries used in this project are : 
  - speech_recognition
  - webbrowser 
  - pyttsx3
  
In this project we take the instructions from the users such as - 
  1. Play Music
  2. Search on Google
  3. Open App
  
  In this project the input which is taken from the user in the audio format is converted to text by using python's "pyttsx3" library
  and the "speech_recognition" library is used to recognise the audio input from the user to the system. This library is specially used 
  for the understanding of the voice command given by the user. As the voice of a human can vary from person to person so this library
  handle's all types of voices be it a man's voice, women's voice, child's voice, elder's voice or may it be of any pitch. 
  speech_recognition library understands and recognises the voice input for the system to process it.
